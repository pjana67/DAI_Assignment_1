This Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) focuses on identifying patterns and risk factors associated with heart disease using a dataset from the UCI repository.

The analysis is divided into two key parts:

1️⃣ Univariate Analysis (Single Variable Insights)

We examined the distribution and key statistics of individual features:
Age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and max heart rate were analyzed to understand normal ranges and outliers.
Categorical variables (chest pain type, ECG results, exercise-induced angina, etc.) were visualized to assess their frequencies and distributions.

2️⃣ Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis (Relationships Between Variables)

Correlation Matrix: Identified strong relationships (e.g., oldpeak vs. exang, age vs. thalach).
Categorical vs. Target Analysis: Examined the impact of chest pain type, thalassemia, and ST depression on heart disease prevalence.
Age vs. Cholesterol & Blood Pressure: Showed how risk factors increase with age, particularly in males.
Exercise-Induced Angina: Strongly linked to lower max heart rate and higher ST depression.

Key Findings:

Older men with high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and exercise-induced angina are at the highest risk. Chest pain type, ST depression, and max heart rate are the most important predictors of heart disease. Lifestyle factors like exercise and blood pressure management play a crucial role in reducing risk.

This analysis provides actionable insights into heart disease risk factors, aiding early detection and prevention.
